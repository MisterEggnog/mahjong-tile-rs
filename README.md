I created this library for a rust project, however, after spending a while on this I learned that (for now) rust was not the best fit.
Since I have spent a long time on this library, I would still like to show something for my effort.
I do not think this library is of suitable quality for crates.io, so I am releasing it on Github if it proves useful.

Before I am comfortable posting this to crates.io I would like to use this library to some degree in an actual project, to see if these design decisions were the right ones.
