I created this library for a rust project, however, after spending a while on this I learned that (for now) rust was not the best fit for the project.
Since I have spent a long time on this library, I would still like to have this to show something for my effort.
However, I do not think this library is suitable quality for crates.io & I have serious doubts if this is even going in the right direction for this domain.

So once again I am just uploading this library to github, in the event someone wants to use it.
