I created this library for a rust project, however, after spending a while on this I learned that (for now) rust was not the best fit.
Since I have spent a long time on this library, I would still like to show something for my effort.
However, I do not think this library is of suitable quality for crates.io & I have serious doubts if this is even going in the right direction for this problem.

So I am just uploading this library to github, in the event someone wants to use it.
